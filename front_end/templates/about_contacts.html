					<h4 style="margin-top:0">As the water-Tool has arisen</h4>
					<p>Drinking water is considered the best controlled food in Germany. And yet we know very little about the water that comes out of our taps. Many municipalities publish the study results on its websites. these data are available for the citizens - but not tangible. What does a hardness of 9? Are 200 milligrams calcium per liter lot or a little? How rich in minerals is our tap water, can only be seen when we compare it with water from the market.</p>
					<p>This is now possible for the region Heilbronn. The idea came in late February at the Open Data Day in Heilbronn. Although many data were available online, they had to be placed in a machine-readable form first. Many municipalities only publish PDF files with the annual averages. These are not machine-readable, and had to be carried by the editors.  To program the application, a single record is necessary. On some websites of municipalities the information sought in the drinking water were hidden on sub-pages, outdated or incomplete. In many towns and cities, we have therefore requested the data via email. Only three municipalities came so far no response.</p>
					<p>It was surprising to us how different the drinking water is composed in the region. Mostly the mineral content within the village differs greatly - namely when there are different service areas. Municipalities as Bad Friedrichshall, Neckarsulm or Zaberfeld are divided into several areas. This was a particular challenge in the data collection phase. The areas had partly be assigned to the roads, so that the user gets the correct values ​​for its own road appears. The drinking water prices offers the Statistical Office a complete data set for all counties - for drinking water quality, there is such public record does not exist.</p>
					<p>The application of these zugrundliegende record was therefore a complex research project. Not less burdensome were implementation and visualization for the developer Felix Ebert, Ulrich Holly and Tom Goerner. A large role was played by user-friendliness and design. From dry figures an interactive graphic to be built, through which the user gets access to his drinking. For the graphical elements Heiko was not responsible.</p> 
					<p>The water application is a beta version. In particular, the data collection can never be completed. Many municipalities publish soon the current average annual values ​​- they should also be updated in our application. We are dependent on the cooperation of the town halls and have set up a contact region. Due to the large data set may cause erroneous information. Who discovered Auffälligkeifen can contact us anytime. We welcome all feedback.</p>
					<p>Data and code of the application are open to the public and available under an open source license.</p>
					<p>You're interested in more open data applications or even want to participate? In Heilbronn we meet regularly in the context of <a href="http://codefor.de">code for Germany</a> to jointly implement open data projects - we would be pleased about your visit!</p>
